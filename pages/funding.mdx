## End of the Founder Program

At launch of the Alpha version, we introduced the **Founders program** a bit hastily, mainly to cover **high server costs**. Since then, we’ve taken a step back and put a lot more thought into the **business model** so it’s simpler, fairer, and more sustainable.


### What’s changing with Version 1 (2026)

With the arrival of **Version 1 in June 2026**, the Founder program will end and be replaced by a **season pass system**. The season pass is optional to support the game; the game is completely free to play and will remain so.

- **$24 per season (4 months)** (equivalent to $6/ month)
- **$60 for 3 seasons (1 year)** (equivalent to $5/ month)

---

### Gems → Season Pass Conversion

All gems you own will be **converted into season passes** according to the ratio below:

| Tier         | Gems  | Season Passes     |
|--------------|-------|-------------------|
| Founder      | 3,000 | 1 |
| Gold Founder | 7,000 | 3 |
| VIP Founder  | 14,000| 6 |


If you made **multiple purchases**, they will be **combined**.

---

### Founder Titles & Skins

Your **Founder title** (regardless of tier) will be **kept forever** in-game and on Discord and will **no longer be obtainable**.  
A **unique character skin** will also be granted for **each tier** by the end of the Founders program.

---

### Included with the Season Pass

  Unlock rewards when you unlock achievement points, such as events token and exclusive skins.
