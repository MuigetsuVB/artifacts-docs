# Donation 
Artifacts is free to use, but it's not free to run. Every contribution will directly support server maintenance, which is essential for our operations. If you'd like to help support the project, you can donate to the developers using the link below.

The in-game/website badge will be distributed in season 3 and the gems will be available by the end of the year. 
You will have access to test servers approximately one week before the deployment of each season.

You will be contacted by e-mail to link your in-game account and Discord.

If you don't want any counterpart, you can make a donation of any size directly to the campaign.
