## End of the Founder Program

At launch, we introduced the **Founders program** a bit hastily, mainly to cover **high server costs**. Since then, we’ve taken a step back and put a lot more thought into the **business model** so it’s simpler, fairer, and more sustainable.


### What’s changing with Version 1 (2026)

With the arrival of **Version 1 in early 2026**, the Founder program will end and be replaced by a traditional subscription.  The subscription is optional to support the game; the game is completely free to play and will remain so.

- **$6/ month**, or  
- **$60/ year** (equivalent to **$5/ month**)

---

### Gems → Subscription Conversion

All gems you own will be **converted into subscription time** according to the ratio below:

| Tier         | Gems  | Subscription Time |
|--------------|-------|-------------------|
| Founder      | 3,000 | **5 months**      |
| Gold Founder | 7,000 | **12 months**     |
| VIP Founder  | 14,000| **24 months**     |

If you made **multiple purchases**, they will be **combined**.

---

### Founder Titles & Skins

Your **Founder title** (regardless of tier) will be **kept forever** in-game and on Discord and will **no longer be obtainable**.  
A **unique character skin** will also be granted for **each tier** by the end of the Founders program.

---

### Included with the Subscription
