# New account

The quick start guide should take around 5 minutes to complete and will guide a new user through some common HTTP requests when working with the Artifacts API.

The guide will feature examples with cURL and Javascript, but you can find examples in your preferred programming language directly on [Postman](https://www.postman.com/technical-astronomer-98717517/workspace/artifacts-mmo/collection/21288292-e66222ff-825e-4ad9-8764-9667b3311629).

You can also send requests directly on [Postman](https://www.postman.com/technical-astronomer-98717517/workspace/artifacts-mmo/collection/21288292-e66222ff-825e-4ad9-8764-9667b3311629), if you want to test without using a programming language.

## Create account

The first step is to [create an account on our site](https://artifactsmmo.com/account/create) and get your token [by logging in](https://artifactsmmo.com/account). It's also possible to do this via API requests, but we'll start simply for this guide. **The token is used by the api to identify you when you make requests. It is important to keep it secret.**

## Create your first character

Now we can create your first character!

In the query, you'll need to change the character's name and choose a skin.

Here's the list of available skins:
|![skin1](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/images/characters/men1.png)|![skin2](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/images/characters/men2.png)|![skin3](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/images/characters/men3.png)|![women1](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/images/characters/women1.png)|![women2](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/images/characters/women2.png)|![women3](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/images/characters/women3.png)
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|men1|men2|men3|women1|women2|women3
When a request asks for a specific value, like for the skin, all possible choices are listed in the [Reference API right here](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/redoc#tag/Characters/operation/create_character_characters_create_post).

The response includes all your character's variables: hit point, attack, position on the map, equipment, inventory, etc.

You can view this information on your characters at any time using this query:

Now we're ready to start playing with our character.
