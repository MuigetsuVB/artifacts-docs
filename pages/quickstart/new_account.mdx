# New account

The quick start guide should take around 5 minutes to complete and will guide a new user through some common requests when working with the Artifacts API.

The guide provides examples using with cURL and Javascript but you can see more examples in the API Reference and send your request directly from your browser.


## Create account

The first step is to [create an account on our site](https://artifactsmmo.com/account/create) and get your token [by logging in](https://artifactsmmo.com/account). It's also possible to do this via API requests, but we'll start simply for this guide.

The token is used by the server to identify you when you make requests.&#x20;
**It is important to keep it secret.**

## Create your first character

Now we can create your first character! To do this, we're going to send our first POST request.
In the request, you'll need to choose your character's name and select a skin.

Here's the list of available skins:

Here's the list of available skins:
|![skin1](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/images/characters/men1.png)|![skin2](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/images/characters/men2.png)|![skin3](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/images/characters/men3.png)|![women1](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/images/characters/women1.png)|![women2](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/images/characters/women2.png)|![women3](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/images/characters/women3.png)
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|men1|men2|men3|women1|women2|women3

When a request needs a specific value, like for the skin, all possible choices are listed in the Reference API.

```http filename="cURL" copy
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.artifactsmmo.com/characters/create' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE' \
--data-raw '{
  "name": "INSERT_NAME_HERE",
  "skin": "INSERT_SKIN_CODE"
}'
```

```js filename="Javascript" copy
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Accept", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE");

var raw = JSON.stringify({
   "name": "INSERT_NAME_HERE",
   "skin": "INSERT_SKIN_CODE"
});

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'POST',
   headers: myHeaders,
   body: raw,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.artifactsmmo.com/characters/create", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
```

The response includes all your character's variables: hit point, attack, level, position on the map, equipment, inventory, etc.

You can view this information again at any time using this request:

```http filename="cURL" copy
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/characters' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE'
```
 
```js filename="Javascript" copy
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Accept", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE");

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'GET',
   headers: myHeaders,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/characters", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
```
