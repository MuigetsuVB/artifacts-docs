## What is Artifacts?

Artifacts is an **asynchronous MMORPG** in which you can control up to **5 characters at the same time**. Your characters can fight monsters, gather resources, craft items and much more. 

Unlike a traditional game, you'll have to **write your own scripts** in your preferred programming language to control your characters via an API.

This short guide will help you learn how to move your character, kill your first monster, gather ores and craft your first weapon.  

The quickstart tutorial contains examples with cURL and Javascript, but it's possible to see examples with dozens of other programming languages on the [Reference API](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/docs/#/).

## Before you start

The first step is to [create your account](https://artifactsmmo.com/account/create) and your first character [by logging in](https://artifactsmmo.com/account/characters).
After that you'll need your token, which you can find [on your account](https://artifactsmmo.com/account/).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
The token is used by the server to identify you when you make requests.&#x20;
**It is important to keep it secret.**
</Callout>

I also recommand you open the web client by [clicking here](https://artifactsmmo.com/client). 
This is the easiest way to view your characters (xp, skills, inventory, equipment) and the Artifacts world map.

## Moving

The 2D world uses a movement system with X,Y coordinates.

![Map](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/images/docs/map.png)

To move, you'll need to know the coordinates of the map you want to move your character to. There are several ways of doing this, including using an [API request](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/docs/#/operations/all_maps_maps__get), but for the purposes of this guide, we're going to use the information available in the client.

If you look at (-4,1) on the map, you'll find the Yellow Slime. A low-level monster that's easy enough to kill when you start the game. We're going to fight him.

By default, your character spawns in position (0,0) on the map. To move him, you'll need to make your first POST request.  

We'll show you examples in cURL and Javascript in the guide, but you can send API requests directly from your browser and see examples in other programming languages in the [API Reference](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/docs/#/operations/action_move_my__name__action_move_post).

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
To control a character, you need to insert its name in the url of your API request.
</Callout>

```http filename="cURL" copy
curl --location -g --request POST 'https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/INSERT_CHARACTER_NAME/action/move' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE' \
--data-raw '{
  "x": 4,
  "y": -1
}'
```
```js filename="Javascript" copy
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Accept", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE");

var raw = JSON.stringify({
   "x": 4,
   "y": -1
});

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'POST',
   headers: myHeaders,
   body: raw,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/INSERT_CHARACTER_NAME/action/move", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
```

After moving, your character will be on a cooldown and you won't be able to make an action again until the cooldown expires. Try sending another moving request to see the response for a cooldown error code.
