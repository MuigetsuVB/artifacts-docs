# Recover your hit points

When you finish a fight, you need to recover your hit points when you lose them.

The easiest way to do this is to rest.

To do this, you can execute this POST request when your combat cooldown is over.
 
```http filename="cURL" copy
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/{INSERT_CHARACTER_NAME_HERE}/action/rest \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
```
```js filename="Javascript" copy
const url = 'https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/{INSERT_CHARACTER_NAME_HERE}/action/rest';
const options = {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    Accept: 'application/json',
    Authorization: 'Bearer INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
  }

};
  
try {
  const response = await fetch(url, options);
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```

The action rest cooldown is one second per 5h HP recovered. 
It's quite effective at low levels, but quickly becomes very time-consuming when you have thousands of hit points.

There's a more productive way with fishing and cooking to craft [food](https://artifactsmmo.com/encyclopedia/items?type=consumable) you can use to regenerate your life. This part is not covered in the tutorial, as you won't need it immediately.
