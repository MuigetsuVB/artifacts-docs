# New mission

To kill monsters faster, you'll need a more powerful weapon. The easiest weapons and equipment to craft when you start the game are those that use **level 1 skill resources**, such as Copper Ore. If you look at the map, you'll see that there's a Copper Rocks resource node at (0,-1).

If you click on **Cooper Ore**, you'll be able to see all the crafts you can do with it.

The simplest weapon to make is the **Copper Dagger**, for which you'll need 6 ores. We're going to make this weapon.

Before gathering ores, you'll need to move to the map (0,-1) using the same POST request.

   redirect: 'follow'
};

   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));

When you're on the map and your cooldown is over, you can make this request to collect resources.

```http filename="cURL" copy
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/INSERT_CHARACTER_NAME/action/gathering' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE'
```
```js filename="Javascript" copy
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Accept", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE");

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'POST',
   headers: myHeaders,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/INSERT_CHARACTER_NAME/action/gathering", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
```

In the response, you'll see that you've gathered 1-2 ores for each request. You'll need to repeat the action a few times until you have **at least 6 ores in your inventory**. You can see the contents of your inventory directly in the response.

You can also see the result of each action in your logs, and view the inventory of all your characters in the client.
