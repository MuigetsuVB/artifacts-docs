# New mission

To kill monsters faster, you'll need a better weapon.
To do this, we're going to upgrade our current weapon to a more powerful one.

Most crafts include skill resources such as ores and wood. To improve our weapon, we'll need to gather Ash Wood, a level 1 woodcutting resource.

 If you look at the map, you'll see that there's a Ash Tree resource node at (-1,0).

If you click on **Ash Wood**, you'll be able to see all the crafts you can do with it.

The craft we're going to make is **Wooden Staff.** Most other equipment that uses wood will need to be transformed into a plank before being used in a craft.

Before gathering woods, you'll need to move to the map (-1,0) using the same POST request.

When you're on the map and your cooldown is over, you can make this request to collect resources.

```http filename="cURL" copy
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/INSERT_CHARACTER_NAME/action/gathering' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE'
```
```js filename="Javascript" copy
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Accept", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE");
 
var requestOptions = {
   method: 'POST',
   headers: myHeaders,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/INSERT_CHARACTER_NAME/action/gathering", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
```

In the response, you'll see that you've gathered 1 wood for each request. You'll need to repeat the action to have **the 4 woods needed in the craft**. You can see the contents of your inventory directly in the response.

You can also see the result of each action in your logs, and view the inventory of all your characters in the client.
