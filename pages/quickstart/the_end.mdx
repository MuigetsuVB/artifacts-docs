# The end
 
The introduction to Artifacts is already coming to an end. You've seen the key concepts that will enable you to start XPing your characters and leveling up your skills. 

There are other concepts such as the bank, the Grand Exchange, equipment, consumables and much more to discover. Read the game concepts whenever you have questions, as they will help you to understand the game better.

I now invite you to build your own adventure and become the great adventurer of Artifacts. I suggest you take a tour of the map and look at everything that exists to give you ideas for goals.

**Here are some ideas of things you can easily do:**
-   Gather copper ores and turn it into copper to make your first equipments .
-   Catch fish and cook them to obtain consumables that will to help you regenerate your life faster.
-   Collect resources to craft enough level 1 weapons to level up Weaponcrating to level 5 and be able to craft more powerful weapons.

The goal of the game is to build automations that will automatically do this for you.

Examples (better examples soon):
-   Python
