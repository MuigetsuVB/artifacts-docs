This was a short introduction to explain the basic concepts of the game.

Artifacts is an MMO in which you can build your own adventure. Now that you understand the basics, you're ready to build your scripts and automate your first tasks.

The API reference includes examples in 5 programming languages, but you're free to use any language you like. You can also use any service that can interact with a REST API, such as Zapier to build automations without programming, or Retool to build a dashboard.

## Somes ideas

Here are some ideas of things you can do quite easily when you start the game.

*   Gather copper to craft the complete copper armor (helmet, chest, legs, boots).
*   Gather wood to craft your first wooden shield.
*   Catch fish and cook them to obtain consumables that will help you kill more powerful monsters. Consumables are items you can use in battle.
*   Collect resources to craft enough level 1 weapons to level up Weaponcrating to level 5 and be able to craft more powerful weapons.&#x20;
