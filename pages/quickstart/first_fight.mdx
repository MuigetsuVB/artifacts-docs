# Your first fight

Now that you're on the map, you're ready to fight the Yellow Slime.

If you click on "Inspect", you'll be able to see the JSON version of the monster. This will help you in the future when writing scripts.

As you can see, the monster is weak, with only 10 hit points and 2 earth attacks. If you look at your stats, you have 1 earth damage from the weapon your character equips by default. You can view the weapon in the "Equipment" tab.

![Stats](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/images/docs/stats_character.png)

You'll need 10 hits to kill the monster, as it doesn't have enough resistance to block your damage. You attack the monster in turn, so it will deal 20 damage. You'll win because you have 50 hit points. Note that if a fight lasts more than 200 turns (100 turns each), you automatically lose it.

Let's attack this monster with this POST request:

```http filename="cURL" copy
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/INSERT_CHARACTER_NAME/action/fight' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE'
```
```js filename="Javascript" copy
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Accept", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE");

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'POST',
   headers: myHeaders,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/INSERT_CHARACTER_NAME/action/fight", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
```

In the response, you can see if you win or lose the fight, complete logs of what happened in each turn, the drops you got and the xp you gain.

To reduce the fight cooldown, your character needs to be more powerful, because the longer the fight, the longer the cooldown.
