In the response, you can see if you win or lose the fight, complete logs of what happened in each turn, the drops you got and the xp you gain.

To reduce the fight cooldown, your character needs to be more powerful, because the longer the fight, the longer the cooldown.

You can also view fight details in the client logs.
