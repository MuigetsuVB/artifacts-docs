# Your first fight

Fights earn your character experience for leveling up, and allow you to drop monster resources for crafting items.

## Monster information

Before fighting a monster, it's important to know its stats.
In the -4,1 map, we'll be fighting a Yellow Slime. Here's the GET request to view the monster's stats:

```http filename="cURL" copy
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.artifactsmmo.com/monsters/yellow_slime' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
```js filename="Javascript" copy
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Accept", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'GET',
   headers: myHeaders,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.artifactsmmo.com/monsters/yellow_slime", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
```

## Fighting

When you create your character, he's already equipped with a weapon. The [Wooden Staff](https://artifactsmmo.com/database/items/wooden_staff) is a level 1 weapon with an attack of 1 earth damage. Your character cannot attack if he has no weapon equipped.

Here's the request to use to start the fight:


```http filename="cURL" copy

--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE'
```
```js filename="Javascript" copy
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Accept", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE");

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'POST',
   headers: myHeaders,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/INSERT_CHARACTER_NAME/action/fight", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));

In the response, you can see if you win or lose the fight, complete logs of what happened in each turn, the drops you got and the xp you gain.

To reduce the fight cooldown, your character needs to be more powerful, because the longer the fight, the longer the cooldown.
