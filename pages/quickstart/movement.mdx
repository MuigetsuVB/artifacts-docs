# Movement and map
  
Movement is very important in Artifacts. Your character will have to move on the map to find monsters to kill, resources to gather and more.

## Maps

The 2D world uses a movement system with X,Y coordinates.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
We are currently developing a game client that will allow you to visualize your characters on the game map in real time. You can try it out by [clicking here](https://artifactsmmo.com/client).
</Callout>

You can use this GET request to get the list of the maps.


```http filename="cURL" copy
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.artifactsmmo.com/maps/?page=1&size=50' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
```js filename="Javascript" copy
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Accept", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'GET',
   headers: myHeaders,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.artifactsmmo.com/maps/?page=1&size=50", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
```

The response includes all the maps in the game and the content of each map. It's the way to find out where you can find a monster or a resource, for example.


## Movement

For our first move, we'll go to -4,1 to kill an easy-to-kill monster. Here's the POST request to use.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
To control a character, you need to insert its name in the url of your API request.
</Callout>

```http filename="cURL" copy
curl --location -g --request POST 'https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/INSERT_CHARACTER_NAME/action/move' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE' \
--data-raw '{
  "x": 4,
  "y": -1
}'
```
```js filename="Javascript" copy
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Accept", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE");

var raw = JSON.stringify({
   "x": 4,
   "y": -1
});

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'POST',
   headers: myHeaders,
   body: raw,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/INSERT_CHARACTER_NAME/action/move", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
```

After moving, your character will be on a cooldown and you won't be able to make an action again until the cooldown expires. Try sending another moving request to see the response for a cooldown error code.
