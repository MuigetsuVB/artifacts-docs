Event Tokens is a feature reserved for members. If you are a founder, you have access to this feature until the game launches.
</Callout>

Event Tokens are a currency reserved for members that allows you to trigger an event of your choice for all players.
This feature is still in development, but currently, each founder account receives 3 tokens per month, for a total of 12 tokens during the season.

**For season 6:**
| Date              | Tokens    |
|-------------------|-----------|
| October 4, 2025   | 3 tokens  |
| November 4, 2025  | 3 tokens  |
| December 4, 2025  | 3 tokens  |
| January 4, 2026   | 3 tokens  |

If you become a founder during the season, you will receive all the tokens you should have received.
The number of tokens you have during a season is limited, so use **them only when absolutely necessary.**

You can spawn an event using this POST request.
