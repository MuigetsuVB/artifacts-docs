# Test Server 
 
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Test Server is a feature reserved for members. If you are a founder, you have access to this feature until the game launches.
</Callout>

The test server is a temporary server that allows you to test the new Artifacts season before its official release, usually about a week before the season launches.

The encyclopedia, public API, and documentation **are available for free to everyone**. However, to connect to the server and use the sandbox features, you must be a member.
 
The test server for **Season 6** will be available starting **September 13**.
