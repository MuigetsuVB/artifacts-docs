# Sandbox Server

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Sandbox Server is a feature reserved for members. If you are a founder, you have access to this feature until the game launches.

The sandbox server provides a dedicated environment for testing and developing scripts alongside the official server. It offers additional endpoints to validate any scenario without impacting your main account.
