# Roadmap 

Here's the roadmap to 2025 and beyond, with features scheduled for beta launch.

![Roadmap](https://artifactsmmo.com/images/docs/roadmap.png)

## Combat System

**PHASE 1**
- ~~New Equipment Stats~~
- ~~New Critical Strike System~~
- ~~New Monster Effects System: A system enabling new mechanics for bosses and high-level monsters, such as poison, life regeneration, buffs, or burns. These effects will roll out progressively throughout the year, with the first ones launching this winter.~~
- ~~New Rune System: Each character will be able to equip a rune that alters the functionality of their weapon. For example, you could steal life from your enemy with every critical hit or apply a burn effect. Runes will be added gradually over the year, with the first ones arriving this winter.~~

**PHASE 2**
- The first dungeons and multi-character fights will make their debut. Alongside this, new utilities and runes designed for multi-character combat will be introduced.

**PHASE 3**
- It’s time to find some bot friends because the first raid will launch, allowing you, for the first time, to team up with other players.

## Others features

There are also other features that will be implemented throughout the year. These features are not the main focus for this year, and plans may change. This is only indicative of what is currently planned. 

**HIGH PRIORITY**
- Client/site overhaul with in-game tutorial
- ~~Updated gathering system~~ (partly done, new system of conditions for tools)
- ~~NPC Vendors/sellers~~

**MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- Subscription features
- Equipment upgrades
- Equipment sets
- Buy orders (Grand Exchange)

**LOW PRIORITY**
- Mailbox
- Competition/PVP
- Game content

The roadmap includes just the main lines, of course, but there are other, more minor features in the pipeline.
