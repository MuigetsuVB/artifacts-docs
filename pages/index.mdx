Artifacts is an MMORPG where you can control up to 5 characters using an API. Unlike a traditional game, you'll need to write your own scripts in your favorite programming language to automate your characters.

The API is documented using OpenAPI, which you can access by [clicking here](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/docs/#/).

## Gameplay

Artifacts is a sandbox MMORPG in which you can do whatever you want - there's no set path to follow. 

You can..
*   Fight monsters to gain xp and drops.
*   Gather resources using your skills (Mining, Woodcutting, Fishing)
*   Craft items using your skills (Cooking, Gearcrafting, Weaponcrafting)
*   Sell & buy items from other players at the Grand Exchange.
*	 Do tasks to earn unique rewards.
*  And much more.

## The future

With the release of alpha 1 this summer, we're working hard to finalize the last features, but a roadmap will arrive in the next few months.
