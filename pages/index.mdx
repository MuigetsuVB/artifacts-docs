## Gameplay

Artifacts is a Sandbox MMORPG where you can do whatever you want - there's no set path to follow.  You can send your characters into combat against monsters, obtain resources through harvesting skills such as mining and woodcutting, craft equipment, complete quests and much more.

The game's economy is simulated and influenced by players' actions. Item prices increase and decrease according to demand.

To learn more about the game, check out our  [gameplay  concepts](/concepts/actions), or try the game with our  [quickstart](/quickstart/introduction)  guide.

The game is currently in alpha and  under active development, so we are always adding new features and content.

## Features

The Alpha 2 is now available with the following features:

- Elemental combat system (fire, air, water, earth)
- 35 levels of combat and skills.
- 7 skills (Mining, Woodcutting, Cooking, Gearcrafting, Weaponcrafting, Jewelrycrafting)
- A Grand Exchange for selling/buying items to other players
- Banking system
- Events (exclusive monsters/resources that appear randomly in the world for a limited time)
- A dynamic quest system to get exclusive items.
- An achievements system.

In terms of numbers, this represents **over 185 items, +20 monsters, +80 crafts and 357 maps**.

A game client with a javascript editor will also be available to help you discover the game in the best possible conditions.
 
We have lots of ideas for the future, and a roadmap for the game's future will be published soon.
