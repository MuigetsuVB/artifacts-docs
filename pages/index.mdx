# Overview
 
Artifacts is an MMORPG where you can control up to 5 characters using an API. Unlike a traditional game, you'll need to write your own scripts in your favorite programming language to automate your characters. You can view your characters actions in real time via [our game client](https://artifactsmmo.com/client).

The API is documented using OpenAPI, which you can access by [clicking here](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/docs/#/).
You can try our [Quickstart Guide](/quickstart/new_account) to learn the basics in under five minutes.
