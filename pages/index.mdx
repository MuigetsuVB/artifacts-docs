# Overview

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
The game is still in development. The Alpha version is available, but it's possible that major changes are made during updates, forcing us to reset the server.

Artifacts is an MMORPG where you can control up to 5 characters using an API. Unlike a traditional game, you'll need to write your own scripts in your favorite programming language to automate your characters. You can view your characters actions in real time via [our game client](https://artifactsmmo.com/client).

The API is documented using OpenAPI, which you can access by [clicking here](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/docs/#/).
