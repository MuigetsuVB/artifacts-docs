# Overview

Artifacts is a sandbox MMORPG designed for code lovers, where you control your characters entirely through an HTTP API. Every action your characters can take corresponds to an endpoint you can interact with programmatically. This unique approach lets you automate gameplay, build custom tools, and explore new ways to play.

The API is fully documented using OpenAPI ([view the docs here](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/docs/#/)).
