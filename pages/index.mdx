# Overview
 
**Artifacts** is an **MMORPG** where you can control your 5 characters using an API.
Unlike a traditional game, Arifacts is headless and does not have a first-party client to play the game. Instead, you'll have to create your own scripts in your preferred programming language to automate your characters.

The API is fully documented using OpenAPI and [Redocly](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/redoc). You can send try our [quickstart guide](/quickstart/new_account) to learn the basics in under five minutes.

It's possible to create an account and manage your characters directly on [our website](https://artifactsmmo.com/), but it's very limited. [A database](https://artifactsmmo.com/database) containing all game content is also available.

We have a [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/prEBQ8a6Vs) where you can share your projects, ask questions, or give feedback on what others are building.

## Gameplay

In a few words, Artifacts is an MMO where you can...
 - Move on the map (yes, that's important...) 
 - Fight monsters 
 - Gather resources using your skills (mining, woodcutting, fishing) 
 - Craft items using your skills (cooking, gearcrafting, weaponcrafting) 
 - Sell  and buy items from other players at the Grand Exchange.
 - and much more.
 
The game is still in alpha, **it's just the beginning.**
