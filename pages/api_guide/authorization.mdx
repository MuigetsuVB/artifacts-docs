# Authorization
  
The API requires that you authenticate with a valid JWT bearer token in order to access the API.

You can create an account and get your token directly on [our website](https://artifactsmmo.com/account).

Once you have a JWT bearer token, you can use it to authenticate with the API by including it in the **Authorization** header of every request. The following is an example of authenticating with the API:

```http filename="cURL" copy
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/characters?page=1&size=50' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ENTER_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
```
```js filename="Javascript" copy
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Accept", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer ENTER_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE");

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'GET',
   headers: myHeaders,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/characters?page=1&size=50", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
```

The API will return a 400 Unauthorized error if you attempt to access an endpoint without a valid JWT bearer token.

One common mistake is to forget to include the Bearer prefix in the Authorization header. For example, a proper Authorization header contains the value Bearer .
