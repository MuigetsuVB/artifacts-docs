## Maps
  
The world is in 2D, and each map is identified by an X and Y coordinate.

[View the World Map](https://artifactsmmo.com/database/maps/world)

You can also view the list of maps [on our website](https://artifactsmmo.com/database/maps) or use [an API request](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/docs/#/operations/all_maps_maps__get).

Here's an example of an API request response.

```http filename="JSON" copy
{
  "data": {
    "name": "Forest",
    "code": "forest_1",
    "x": -1,
    "y": -1,
    "content": {
      "type": "monster",
      "code": "red_slime"
    }
  }
}
```

If there's anything on the map, you'll be able to view it in the "content" section.

This is what you can find on a map:
* Monster (All monsters: https://artifactsmmo.com/database/monsters)
* Resource (All ressources: https://artifactsmmo.com/database/resources)
* Workshop (All crafts by workshop : https://artifactsmmo.com/database/crafts)
* Bank
* Grand Exchange


## Movement
 
To do most of the actions in the game, you'll need to move on the map.
The move cooldown is currently fixed at 5 seconds per map. In the future, it will be possible to increase movement speed to reduce this cooldown.

Here's an example of an API request to move your character.

```http filename="cURL" copy
curl --location -g --request POST 'https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/INSERT_CHARACTER_NAME/action/move' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE' \
--data-raw '{
  "x": 4,
  "y": -1
}'
```
```js filename="Javascript" copy
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Accept", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE");

var raw = JSON.stringify({
   "x": 4,
   "y": -1
});

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'POST',
   headers: myHeaders,
   body: raw,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/INSERT_CHARACTER_NAME/action/move", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
```
