## Maps

The world is made up of several layers (underground, overworld, interior), and each map can be identified by X and Y coordinates within a layer or by a unique Map ID.

You can also view the list of maps [on our website](https://artifactsmmo.com/encyclopedia/maps) or use [an API request](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/docs/#/operations/get_all_maps_maps__get).

Here is an example of an API request response.

```http filename="JSON" copy
{
  "data": {
    {
      "map_id": 1,
      "name": "Forest",
      "skin": "forest_3",
      "x": -5,
      "y": -5,
      "layer": "overworld",
      "access": {
        "type": "standard",
        "conditions": []
      },
      "interactions": {
        "content": null,
        "transition": null
      }
    },
  }
}
```

### Access

A map can have several types of access:
 - standard: Tile accessible normally
 - blocked: Inaccessible, used for void or obstacles like mountains, rivers, etc.
 - teleportation: Only accessible via a teleportation potion
 - conditional: Only accessible if the conditions are met.

Here are the existing operators for conditions:

- has_item: Have a specific item in your inventory or equipped.
- cost: A cost in item or gold.
- achievement_completed: Have completed a specific achievement.

### Content

If there is anything on the map, you will be able to view it in the "content" section inside "interactions".

Existing content types:
* Monster (All monsters: https://artifactsmmo.com/encyclopedia/monsters)
* Resource (All resources: https://artifactsmmo.com/encyclopedia/resources)
* Workshop (All crafts by workshop: https://artifactsmmo.com/encyclopedia/items)
* Bank
* Grand Exchange
* Tasks Master
* NPC (All NPCs: https://www.artifactsmmo.com/encyclopedia/npcs)


## Movement

### Move
To perform most actions in the game, you will need to move on the map.
The move cooldown is currently fixed at 5 seconds per map. Pathfinding (A*) calculates the shortest route while avoiding blocked tiles.

Here is an example of an API request to move your character.

```http filename="cURL" copy
curl --location -g --request POST 'https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/INSERT_CHARACTER_NAME/action/move' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE' \
--data-raw '{
  "x": 4,
  "y": -1
}'
```
```js filename="Javascript" copy
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Accept", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE");

var raw = JSON.stringify({
   "x": 4,
   "y": -1
});

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'POST',
   headers: myHeaders,
   body: raw,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/INSERT_CHARACTER_NAME/action/move", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
```

### Transition

The other way to move in the game is to use transitions present on a map. A transition represents doors, stairs, boats, and similar features. It allows you to teleport from one tile to another, either on the same layer or to a different layer. A transition always has a cooldown of 5 seconds.

Here is an example of a map with a transition:

```http filename="JSON" copy
{
  "data": {
    "map_id": 1231,
    "name": "Sandwhisper Isle",
    "skin": "desertisland_10",
    "x": -3,
    "y": 19,
    "layer": "overworld",
    "access": {
      "type": "standard",
      "conditions": []
    },
    "interactions": {
      "content": {
        "type": "monster",
        "code": "sandwarden"
      },
      "transition": {
        "map_id": 1233,
        "x": -3,
        "y": 19,
        "layer": "interior",
        "conditions": [
          {
            "code": "sandwhisper_key",
            "operator": "cost",
            "value": "1"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here are the existing operators for conditions:

- has_item: Have a specific item in your inventory or equipped.
- cost: A cost in item or gold.
- achievement_completed: Have completed a specific achievement.

Here is an example of an API request to use a transition.

```http filename="cURL" copy
curl --location -g --request POST 'https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/INSERT_CHARACTER_NAME/action/transition' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE' \
--data-raw '{
  "x": 4,
  "y": -1
}'
```
```js filename="Javascript" copy
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Accept", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer INSERT_TOKEN_HERE");

var raw = JSON.stringify({
   "x": 4,
   "y": -1
});

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'POST',
   headers: myHeaders,
   body: raw,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/INSERT_CHARACTER_NAME/action/transition", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
```
