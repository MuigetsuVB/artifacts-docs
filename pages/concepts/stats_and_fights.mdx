## Stats

Here are all the stats a player can have:

*   Hit points (HP)
*   Elemental attacks (fire, water, earth,air)
*   Elemental damages (fire, water, earth,air)
*   Elementals resistance (fire, water, earth,air)
*   Haste

You can view your character's stats directly [on the site ](https://artifactsmmo.com/account/characters)or use [this request](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/docs/#/operations/get_my_characters_my_characters_get).

### Elemental attacks

Attack is the basic stats. Each attack removes one hit point from its opponent.

### Elemental damages

Damage increases the attack of an element, it is given by consumables and equipment.

Here's the formula for calculating the effects of damage:
**Attack \* (Damage \* 0.01)**

For example, if a player has a base attack of 100 and a damage buff of 30, the output damage will be 130.
1 damage buff = 1% extra base damage (1 extra damage using the example above)

### Elemental resistances

Resistance reduces the attack damage of its opponent, the more resistance a player/monster has, the more chance he has of blocking the opponent's attacks, it is given by consumables and equipment.

Here's the formula for calculating the effects of damage reduction: 
**Attack \* (Resistance \* 0.01)**

For example, if a monster has a resistance buff of 30 and the player has 100 attack, the monster will block 30 damage. 
1 resistance buff = 1% damage reduction (1 less damage using the example above)

### Block 

Block is the chance that you negate the damage of your opponent's attack for a given element type.

Here's the formula to calculate the chance of blocking in % format:
**(Resistance / 10)**

For example, A player with a resistance buff of 10 would result in a 1% chance of blocking.
1 resistance buff = 0.1% chance of blocking.

### Haste

The haste reduces the cooldown of a fight. You'll find more info in the Fights section below.

## Fights

Combat is based on a turn-by-turn system. The player always attacks first.&#x20;

Fights can take a maximum of 100 turns (i.e. 50 attacks for the player, 50 attacks for the monster), otherwise you've automatically lost the fight.

For the moment, there are no consequences to losing a fight, but this should change in the future.

Each round of combat adds 2 seconds of cooldown. Haste (equipment stats) reduces cooldown time. The minimum combat cooldown is 5 seconds.

Here's the formula for calculating the cooldown:
**Turns \* 2 - (Haste \* 0.01) \* (Turns \* 2)**

For example, if a fight takes 20 turns and a player has 10 haste, the cooldown will be reduced by 4 seconds. 36 instead of 40 seconds. 1 haste = 1% less.

### Equipments and consumables&#x20;

To help you in fight, you can equip equipment and consumables. A consumable is consumed automatically when it meets a specific condition.

Here's everything you can equip:

*   Helmet (helmet)
*   Body armor
*   Leg armor
*   Boots
*   Weapon
*   Shield&#x20;
*   Ring (2 slots)

*   Artifact (3 slots)
*   Consumable (2 slots)
