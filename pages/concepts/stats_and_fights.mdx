*   Haste

You can view your character's stats directly [on the site](https://artifactsmmo.com/my/characters) or use [this request](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/docs/#/operations/get_my_characters_my_characters_get).

### Elemental attacks

Attack is the basic stats. Each attack removes one hit point from its opponent.

### Elemental damages

Damage increases the attack of an element, it is given by utilities and equipment.
If an equipment or utility gives damages without specifying the element, it applies to all elements.

Damage is rounded during the calculation process. The damage calculation does not happen all at once.

Here's the formula for calculating the effects of damage:
**Round(Attack \* Round(Damage \* 0.01))**

For example, if a player has a base attack of 100 and a damage buff of 30, the output damage will be 130.
1 damage buff = 1% extra base damage (1 extra damage using the example above)

**Important Rounding Rules:**
- .5 always rounds up
- Below .5 rounds down

**Multi-Element Weapons:**
If your weapon has multiple elements (many of them do), this calculation is done independently for each element. If you look at the fight logs, you'll see that a separate attack instance happens for each element the attacker has.

### Critical strike

Critical strike gives you a chance to perform a strike that will perform 1.5x the total attack.

For example, if a player has 10 critical strikes, he has a 10% chance of performing a critical strike.
1 critical strike = 1% critical strike. If he hits 100 without a critical hit, then he'll hit 150 if he performs a critical hit.

### Elemental resistances

Resistance reduces the attack damage of its opponent.

Resistance is rounded during the calculation process. Resistance uses the same logic as damage.

Here's the formula for calculating the effects of damage reduction, it is given by utilities and equipment.
**Round(Attack * Round(Resistance * 0.01))**

For example, if a monster has a resistance buff of 30 and the player has 100 attack, the monster will block 30 damage. 1 resistance buff = 1% damage reduction (1 less damage using the example above)


### Haste

The haste reduces the cooldown of a fight. You'll find more info in the Fights section below.

### Wisdom and Prospecting

Wisdom and prospecting are stats that give you bonuses at the end of combat.

Wisdom increases the XP you'll earn (1 wisdom = 0.1% more xp).
Your xp rate is 100%, if you have 100 wisdom your total xp rate is 110%. 


Prospecting increases your chance of dropping items. (1 prospecting = 0.1% more chance of dropping).
Your basic drop chance is 100%, if you have 100 prospecting your total drop chance is 110%. 

## Fights

Combat is based on a turn-by-turn system. The player always attacks first.&#x20;

Fights can take a maximum of 100 turns (i.e. 50 attacks for the player, 50 attacks for the monster), otherwise you've automatically lost the fight.
If you lose a fight, you return to the spawn (0,0) with 1 HP.

Each round of combat adds 2 seconds of cooldown. Haste (equipment stats) reduces cooldown time. The minimum combat cooldown is 5 seconds.

Here's the formula for calculating the cooldown:
**Turns * 2 - (Haste * 0.01) * (Turns * 2)**

For example, if a fight takes 20 turns and a player has 10 haste, the cooldown will be reduced by 4 seconds. 36 instead of 40 seconds. 1 haste = 1% less.
 
### Equipments and utilities&#x20;

To help you in fight, you can equip equipment and utilities. A utility is consumed automatically when it meets a specific condition.

Here's everything you can equip:

*   Helmet (helmet)
*   Body armor
*   Leg armor
*   Boots
*   Weapon
*   Shield&#x20;
*   Ring (2 slots)

### Equip

To equip an item, your character must meet all the item's conditions. An item's conditions can use any character variable and an operator such as gt, lt, or eq.

For example, the [Iron Sword](https://www.artifactsmmo.com/encyclopedia/items/iron_sword/) requires your character to be above level 9.

```http filename="JSON" copy
{
...
  "conditions": [
    {
      "code": "level",
      "operator": "gt",
      "value": 9
    }
  ],
....
}
```
