## Cooldown

When you make an action, you instantly receive the result, but your character will be in a cooldown period for some time after you've made the majority of the game's actions.

If you are in cooldown and try to make an action, you will receive an error 499 showing the remaining cooldown time.


## Logs

Every action you take is logged. You can view a character's logs with this request:

```http filename="cURL" copy
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/YOUR_CHARACTER_NAME_HERE/logs?page=1&size=50' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ENTER_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
```
```js filename="Javascript" copy
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Accept", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer ENTER_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE");

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'GET',
   headers: myHeaders,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/YOUR_CHARACTER_NAME_HERE/logs?page=1&size=50", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
```
