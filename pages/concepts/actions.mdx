## Cooldown

When you make an action, you instantly receive the result, but your character will be in a cooldown period for some time after you've made the majority of the game's actions.

| Name               | Content                              |
| ----------------   | ---------------------------------- |
| Movement        |5s per map |
| Fight             |2s per turn (reduce with haste)|
| Crafting  |5s per item|
| Recycling |2s per item|
| Gathering   |25s (reduce with skill level and tools)|
| Others   |3s|


If you are in cooldown and try to make an action, you will receive an error 499 showing the remaining cooldown time.


## Logs

Every action you take is logged. You can view a character's logs with this request:

```http filename="cURL" copy
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/YOUR_CHARACTER_NAME_HERE/logs?page=1&size=50' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ENTER_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
```
```js filename="Javascript" copy
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Accept", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
myHeaders.append("Authorization", "Bearer ENTER_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE");

var requestOptions = {
   method: 'GET',
   headers: myHeaders,
   redirect: 'follow'
};

fetch("https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/YOUR_CHARACTER_NAME_HERE/logs?page=1&size=50", requestOptions)
   .then(response => response.text())
   .then(result => console.log(result))
   .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
```
