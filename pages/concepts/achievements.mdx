# Achievements
 
Achievements are objectives to be met during the season by all your characters. They grant you gold and achievement points, which allow you to earn season badges.

> **Note:** Achievements are tracked at the account level. All your characters contribute together to unlock achievements.

Achievement points and the number of achievements required to complete a season may change. You can always check the current requirements using the [server status endpoint](https://api.artifactsmmo.com/docs/#/operations/get_server_details__get)
