# Pending Items

Pending items are rewards or items waiting to be claimed by your account. They are generated by various game systems — such as [achievements](/concepts/achievements), [Grand Exchange](/concepts/grand_exchange) buy orders, or events — and stored until one of your characters claims them.

Any character on your account can claim a pending item, as long as they have enough inventory space.

<Callout type="info">
Pending items remain available until claimed. They are not lost if your inventory is full — simply free up space and claim them later.
</Callout>

## Sources

Pending items can come from several sources:

- `achievement` — Rewards from completing [achievements](/concepts/achievements) (gold and/or items).
- `grand_exchange` — Items purchased through [buy orders](/concepts/grand_exchange#buy-orders) on the Grand Exchange.
- `event` — Rewards from in-game events.

## View your pending items

You can view all your unclaimed pending items using the following GET request:

```http filename="cURL" copy
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/pending-items \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
```
```js filename="Javascript" copy
const url = 'https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/pending-items';
const options = {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    Accept: 'application/json',
    Authorization: 'Bearer INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
  }
};

try {
  const response = await fetch(url, options);
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```

Each pending item contains the following information:

```http filename="JSON" copy
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "account": "your_account",
  "source": "achievement",
  "source_id": "kill_chickens_1",
  "description": "Achievement: Kill 100 Chickens",
  "gold": 500,
  "items": "iron_sword:1,copper_ore:10",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T12:00:00.000Z",
  "claimed_at": null
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `id` | Unique identifier for the pending item. |
| `source` | Origin of the item (`achievement`, `grand_exchange`, `event`). |
| `source_id` | Reference ID from the source (e.g., achievement code, order ID). |
| `description` | Human-readable description. |
| `gold` | Gold amount included in the reward. |
| `items` | Items in format `item_code:quantity`, separated by commas. |
| `claimed_at` | `null` if unclaimed, otherwise the claim timestamp. |

## Claim a pending item

To claim a pending item, use any character on your account with the following POST request:

```http filename="cURL" copy
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/{name}/action/claim_item/{id} \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
```js filename="Javascript" copy
const url = 'https://api.artifactsmmo.com/my/{name}/action/claim_item/{id}';
const options = {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    Accept: 'application/json',
    Authorization: 'Bearer INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
  }
};

try {
  const response = await fetch(url, options);
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```

Replace `{name}` with your character's name and `{id}` with the pending item ID.

<Callout type="warning">
Your character must have enough **inventory space** to claim items. If inventory is full, the request will fail with a `478` error. Gold rewards do not require inventory space.
</Callout>

- Claiming a pending item triggers a **1-second cooldown**.
- Gold is added directly to your account balance.
- Items are added to the character's inventory.
- Once claimed, the pending item is marked as claimed and will no longer appear in your unclaimed list.
