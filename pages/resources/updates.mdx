Here's the patch notes for Season 3.

- `/my/{name}/action/grandexchange/cancel` to cancel a sales order.
- `/my/grandexchange/orders` to view your current sales orders.
- `/my/grandexchange/history` to view your sales history.
- `/grandexchange/orders` to view all sales orders.

- Added `account` to `CharacterSchema`.
- Added variables related to the new Alchemy skill.


**Items:**
- 106 new items.
- Consumables (food) can now be used outside of combat with the endpoint `/my/{name}/action/use`.
- Potions (utility items) can now be used in combat (replacing food in that context).
- 2 new keywords for effects (only for consumables): `heal` to restore life outside combat and `gold` to add golds to the character using the item.
- All items are now tradable (subject to change).

**Tasks:**
- Tasks now reward gold.
- Modified `TaskFullSchema` to include rewards.
- Rewards have been adjusted, with new unique resources and items available.
- For consistency, Task Rewards now use `DropRateSchema`, with rates expressed as `1/rate`.

**Achievements:**
- Achievements are now account-based, so all characters contribute to the same achievements. This is more consistent with the gameplay of Artifacts.
- Achievements now reward gold.
- Achievement-related schemas have been revised  (`BaseAchievementSchema` > `AchievementSchema`, `AchievementSchema` > `AccountAchievementSchema`).
- Modified the endpoint `/characters/{name}/achievements` to `/accounts/{account}/achievements`.

**Accounts:**

**Events:**
- A new event has been added.
- Changed endpoint `/events` to `/events/active`.

**Global Changes:**
- Renamed "golds" to "gold" wherever applicable.
- Replaced literal lists with enums wherever applicable (e.g., list of slots, list of skills).
- **Attempt system for transactions:** A current issue involved requests being blocked by transactions on multi-character/multi-player endpoints. As a test, an attempt system has been set up to try the transaction again before returning a 486 error. This may slow down some requests, but will ensure a response.

**Client:**
- Fixed a bug that displayed the Cancel/Complete buttons on incorrect Task Masters.
- Updated the client to support Season 3 features.
